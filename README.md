# Simple Drink reminder

Just small desktop project to practice Golang and create something to help the better half drink enough

for my reference use: `go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui` to build so that the cmd does show when the exe is run

### TO DO

- [x] restart timer on completion
- [ ] add manual start/stop
- [ ] allow time to be edited in app

### Known issue

- Issue with the first completion where the desktop notification fires twice, further completes work as expected
